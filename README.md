# betteResume

**betteResume** is a Chrome extension designed to simplify the process of tailoring your resume for job applications. It reads job offers from a web page, makes an API call to Mistral AI or Gemini using a user-provided API key, and opens it in Overleaf for further edits. Each generated resume can be retrieved if you're on the job offer website.

## Features

- **Extract Job Offers:** Reads job offers from a web page.
- **Server-less app:** Everything is stored locally in your computer, the only calls to a server are the LLM's API ( There's no other way, right ?)
- **Generate Resume with AI:** Uses Mistral's nano model API or Gemini flash 1.5 LLM to tailor your resume based on job offers.
- **API Key encryption** Uses AES-GCM 256 to store securely the API key in extension's storage.
- **Resume management** Each generated resume is associated to the webpage of the job offer. Open the job link and your resume will be retrieved !
- **Output Formats:** Opens the resume directly in Overleaf website
- **Resume Input:** Allows you to paste your resume in LaTeX format.
