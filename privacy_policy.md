Last updated: 09/16/2024

Thank you for using our Chrome extension! This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our extension. Please read this carefully to understand how your data is handled.
Please note that this extension was first an idea for a personal use, so i thought it would be useful for others and decided to publish it. The extension is free to use and the source code is public. 

1. What Data We Collect
   
Our Chrome extension collects  the following data:
API Key: When you input your API key to interact with an external LLM, it is stored locally and encrypted in Chrome extension storage.
Resume Data: If you paste your resume into the extension, it is also stored locally and may contain personal information such as your name, contact details, and work history.
Job Offer URLs and Tailored Resumes: We store every URL of job offers you scrape using the extension, along with the tailored resume generated for that job offer.

2. How We Use the Data

LLM Processing: The resume data is sent to third-party LLM APIs (Gemini and Mistral) for processing to create tailored resumes. This interaction is purely for the purpose of processing your request and is done securely.
Local Storage: Data such as the API key, pasted resumes, job offer URLs, and tailored resumes are stored locally in the Chrome extension storage to improve user experience.
No External Storage: We do not store or transmit your data to any server controlled by us. All processing happens locally on your device except for the communication with LLM APIs. and visualizing the resume, which uses Overleaf.

3. Third-party Services

The extension interacts with the following third-party services:

Gemini and Mistral LLM APIs: These APIs are used to process resume data and generate tailored responses. Please refer to their privacy policies for more information on how they handle your data.
Overleaf: This service is used to handle LaTeX-based resumes. However, it is not directly integrated into the extension and only provides a platform to view or manage the resume.

4. Data Security

No Server or Database: We do not operate a server or database; all processing is done on the user's device.
Encryption: The API key is stored in an encrypted manner in Chrome extension storage to ensure its security.

5. User Rights

Managing Your Data: You have full control over your data. The resume, API key, job offer URLs, and tailored resumes stored locally in the Chrome extension can be deleted by:
Clearing Chrome extension storage.
